Code Reviewer                                         *CodeReviewer* *review*
                              Version 0.1.0

If you do code reviews on a regular basis, this script could be of
help to you. This tip is about -
1. Helping the reviewer review code 
2. Helping the author in collating reviews from various peers 
3. Helping the author in fixing the review comments

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

{Vi does not have any of this}

INSTALLATION                                       *codereviewer_installation*

Typically one would put CodeReview.vim into the .vim/plugin directory
(vimfiles\plugin for Windows) where it becomes automatically available
for use.

To add this help file to vim's help, copy this to .vim/doc directory
(vimfiles\doc for Windows) and do: >
 :helptags ~/.vim/doc
or (for windows) >
 :helptags $VIMRUNTIME\..\vimfiles\doc
See |add-local-help| for more information

A syntax file for review comments is provided (rev.vim). This should be
put in .vim/syntax (vimfiles\syntax for windows)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE                                                     *codereviewer_usage*

                                                      *g:CodeReviewer_reviewer*
First, you need to set your initials that would be used in the review
comment. For this, set the CodeReviewer_reviewer variable: >
  let g:CodeReviewer_reviewer="KG"  " Your initials
The variable must be set to a string that contains only alphabets
([a-zA-Z]\+). You can put this in your .vimrc/_vimrc file

                                                    *g:CodeReviewer_reviewFile*
Next, to specify the file to be used for entering the review comments, use: >
  let g:CodeReviewer_reviewFile="file_name.rev"   " Set review file name
As an example: >
  let g:CodeReviewer_reviewFile="$HOME . "/review_KG.rev"
Note:
1. The file name must end in ".rev". This is used for autodetecting
   the file type for syntax highlighting
2. In specifying the path, always use the "/" seperator

The working directory of vim/gvim is to be set before the reviewer
start inserting comments. Suppose the sources have been sent to the reviewer
in the directory tree as shown below:
        top/
        |-- Readme
        |-- inc
        |   `-- file.h
        |-- review
        `-- src
            `-- file.cpp
Assume that the three files - Readme, file.h and file.cpp are to be reviewed
and the comments are to be stored in top/review/comments.txt. Open a vim/gvim
session, and change directory to review (see |:cd|). This is needed to insert
the correct relative paths in the review comments file

Now you are ready to start the review. To insert review comments in
the currently viewed file, use: >
 \ic
This should put a line like shown below in the review file,
   ../inc/file.h:20: KG - [Defect]
and leave you in insert mode after "[Defect]". You can now type your comments
(on multiple lines).

By default, in sorting commands that can be done on the file, the
commands that follow a "file_name:line_number" are chunked together.
So, if you have:
   ../inc/file.h:20: KG - [Defect] A major review defect that
             continues on the line below. These lines will
             be chunked together for the sorting commands that
             follow. The next review comment in on the line
             below
   ../inc/file.h:40: KG - [Remark] Next remark starts...

If you'd like to chunk two (or more) review remarks together in the
sorting operations that follow, you must use the line continuation
character "\" as shown below:
   ../inc/file.h:20: KG - [Defect] A major review defect that
             continues on the line below. These lines will
             be chunked together for the sorting commands that
             follow. The next review comment in on the line
             below, and gets chunked with this one because of the
             line continuation symbol at the end of this line \
   ../inc/file.h:40: KG - [Remark] Next remark starts...

Once your (and other peer's) comments are ready, you can concatenate them into
one review file (using unix "cat" or similar command - ofcourse you can use
vim for this too!)

Next step is to probably sort the file so that in a review meeting you can go
thro' all the comments for a file (in the order of line numbers) and then go
to the next file. To do this, open the collated review file, set the
g:CodeReviewer_reviewFile to the path to the collated file, and use: >
 :SortReviewFile
After sorting, it might be required to put all the defects first, questions
next, and the remarks in the end. For doing this, use: >
 :let g:CodeReviewer_sortDefects=1
before doing the sort.
Sorting preserves the "chunking" as defined earlier.
Note: :SortReviewFile assumes the presence of an external sort program that is
POSIX.2 compilant.

To browse through your review comments, use: >
 :CheckReview
You can use the quickfix commands (see |quickfix|) to browse

The default keymap uses \ic. If you would like to use something other
than '\', you may simply change the leader (see |mapleader|).

You can avoid loading this plugin by setting the "loaded_CodeReviewer"
variable: >
  :let g:loaded_CodeReviewer = 1

the step between saving position in the file being reviewed and
inserting the comment
